## Goal

The goal of `NHSRtraining` is to supplement the NHSR [Introduction to R and R Studio training](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/intro_r/) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r) with exercises that can be completed as part of the course or 

## Installation

You can install the development version of NHSRtraining from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nhs-r-community/NHSRtraining")
```

Currently the [{parsons} package](https://github.com/rstudio/parsons) is not available on CRAN. This is used to create some of the interactivity of the quiz questions where answers can me moved from one side to another into order. To load this:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/parsons")
```

## Running the tutorials

Unlike with usual packages where `library(NHSRtraining)` would be used, this package uses `learnr` so, once the package is installed, the following code details what is available:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
learnr::available_tutorials("NHSRtraining")
```


and running each tutorial:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

learnr::run_tutorial("list-tutorial-name", package = "NHSRtraining")

```

## Thanks and credits

This package has been greatly inspired in its structure from other "box" training like [Penguins in a box](https://github.com/demar01/penguinsbox) (in both English and Spanish) and [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/). 

Materials used to build the package are from the Forwards workshop: [Packages in a nutshell](https://github.com/forwards/workshops/tree/dc5b9fba5cdfbebc737a0a393b374a18378be122).
